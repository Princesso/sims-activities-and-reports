# Pre-Sims Activities

These are activities that happen before the commencement of `Simulations`.

* Get report on fellows from `M1` (and `Boot Camp`?)
* Meet with fellows
    * Introduction
        * Each person shares
            * Background
            * Experience
            * Goal
        * I share my KPIs to give them an idea of my role in the team(s)
    * Discuss Developer Framework Attributes and Dev Pulse ratings
        * https://framework.andela.com/
        * https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N2rPwsylCviQjxZuelD7VWpUfPRHFJL_-BI7QTiFoVM/edit#gid=1919530228
        * What I think of when rating fellows
            * Feedback will always be shared
            * Ratings don't depend on feedback but my confidence in a fellow
            * Confidence is dependent on `context + feedback`
    * Go through all LMS outputs to set expectations.
    * Some things you should know
